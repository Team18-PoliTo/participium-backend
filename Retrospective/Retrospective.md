## ASSESSMENT

### What did go wrong in the sprint?
In the first test sprint, we divided into two groups: front-end and back-end, and this model worked perfectly. In this sprint, we used the same model, but realized that it did not work as well as it should have, since the front-end team had more work to do, and this affected productivity.
We also quickly began development, but there were aspects of the technical specifications that were not fully understood and had to be changed during development.

### What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

More time was allocated to the tests and less was given to risks.

### What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Positive point: Never give up in a sprint, even if there is less time left than expected for some tasks, teamwork can save the sprint.
We did the front-end tests too this time(including test cases), and we complete all e2e test and eachive almost 100 percent of coverage.
Negative: It is necessary to add and monitor intermediate deadlines for each story. 

### Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
We didn't add task for bug fixing but we include time into the task estimation.

### Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

YouTrack chart looks more accurate(didn't achieve) -> We started later then had to because of our schedules missmatching.

### Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

Set and monitor intermediate deadlines. 
Consider having less strict roles in the team.

### One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Our teamwork didn't let us down, and we successfully completed all the stories we added during this sprint.
